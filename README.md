    Bella styles is my own mother's company. She has been working there for around 2 years now. The business has grown alot, and it's growing at a good rate. She has been wanting to expand more, and I think a
    website will help her expand extremely better. She though it was a good idea and she told me to try to create one all by myself. So I did and it took me around five months to do it. The website's purpose
    is to get to more potiential customers and they can find products used at the shop. As of right now I have yet to take picutres and put in some information. This website was just used for something similar
    to a template. 
    
    This website can offer many things such as when the shop will be closed and when the shop will be closing or opening eariler. It also has prices and pictures (when uploaded) of the shop. You can find lots of 
    information about the owner and who all works there. The information has not been uploaded yet, it will be uploaded when the website goes live probably this fall.
    
    
    The primary purpose of the website is to get to potiential customers that are unable to call or have not even heard of the shop and what she offers. The secondary purpose of the website is the inform current 
    customers about changes in either the open times, dates open, and early closings. If I could have any additonal features into the website, I would love to have a feature that could show a live post on facebook,
    so every post would be on the website instantly.
